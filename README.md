# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction

Welcome to the **Employee Salary Predictor** project! This machine learning-powered app estimates an employee's salary based on their personal and professional attributes like age, experience, education, gender, and occupation. It provides a regression-based approach to predict the **exact salary value**.
